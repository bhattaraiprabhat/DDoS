Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the big concerns for cyber security. Similar to most of the vectors in cyber crimes, characteristics and features of DDoS are dynamic. To identify such DDoS attack, Machine Learning has been one of the most successful approaches. The purpose of this article is to introduce DDoS problem and apply Machine Learning techniques to identify attack.

In "DDoS Classification with XGBOOST I.ipynb" file, I have used XGBOOST as a
method to classify the levels in the data. Because DDoS problem has a wide
variety of data, this document focuses only on some of the key techniques in
handling data.
